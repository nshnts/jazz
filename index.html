  <li>  No one can teach you jazz. Jazz is self-taught. Jazz education lets you create your own methodology, 
    which has a direct influence on your individual voice. </li>
  <li> "One" of the bar is
the strongest beat of the bar and as such, is the ultimate resolution beat
in the bar. “Resolution” means that something has ended, consequently
“one” of the bar is not the first beat of the bar; it is the last beat
of the bar. It is the beat toward which melodic ideas are played and at
which they end.</li>
